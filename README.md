# Interactive-Dashboard-Using-Streamlit

## Description
The Interactive Dashboard Using Streamlit project is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for analyzing the sentiment of tweets in real-time and gaining valuable insights. The dashboard leverages Streamlit, a powerful Python library for building interactive web applications, to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

With this dashboard, users can:

- Monitor real-time tweets: The dashboard connects to the Twitter Streaming API to fetch and display tweets in real-time.
- Analyze sentiment: The dashboard utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Visualize sentiment trends: The dashboard presents sentiment analysis results in the form of interactive visualizations, such as pie charts, bar graphs, and word clouds, allowing users to understand sentiment trends at a glance.
- Gain insights: Users can explore different filters, search queries, or time ranges to gain deeper insights into the sentiment of specific topics, events, or hashtags.
